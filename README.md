# CS305_Module_5: Twitter Bot
#### This repository is for a Twitter bot. It is a fun side project that doesn't have anything too advanced; it just allows me to get my feet wet with Twitter's bot API. The project itself uses an MIT license.

# Bot Idea
<br>Automation can be created with the twitter bot to comment on a specific post to direct users to view additional information.<br>
